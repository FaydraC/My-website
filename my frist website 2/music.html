  <font color="00b8e6"> Billie Eilish is a 16 year old singer and songwriter. She wrote her first song, Ocean Eyes, at age 13. <br>
                        She is well known for her songs <strong>You Should See Me in a Crown</strong>, and <strong>When the Partys Over.</strong><br>
                        I love her music because it is very different than any other music I have ever heard. She also has a very wide <br>
                        variety of music, ranging from heavier songs, such as <strong> bury a friend </strong>, to slower songs such as <br>
