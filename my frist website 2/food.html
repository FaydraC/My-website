  <h1><font color="white"> My Favorite Foods </h1> </font>
      <font color="#00b8e6"> I like a lot of different foods, and I am not a very picky eater. I love cooking, and I would love to own<br>
        a restaurant someday. Right now my Grandparents are working on opening their restaurant, where I will be working. They owned a <br>
        food truck called "The Meat Shack BBQ". They have been running for about 3 years now. I would 100% reccomend eating there <br>
        someday. </p>

  <font color="#00b8e6"> One of my favorite dishes to both make and eat is pasta. I love all kinds of pasta, but my favorite is basic spaghetti
    and meatballs.<br> Almost anyone can make it and there are so many different variaions on it.
<br> <br>
<h2><font color=white><u> Ramen </u></h2>

    <font color="00b8e6"> My all time favorite dish to both make and eat is traditional Japanese ramen. Although it is very time consuming, some
      recipes taking over 24 hours, it is worth the wait in the end.<br> Ramen is very costomizable, and anyone can make it. My favorite type of ramen
      is Spicy Tankatsu Ramen (spicy pork).<br><br>
      <h2><font color=white><u> Sushi </u></h2>

    <img src="rescources/images/food/sushi.jpg" alt=sushi width=500></a><br>
    <font color="00b8e6"> Sushi is one of my all time favorite foods, especially spicy salmon rolls. Fish is one of my favorite
      things to eat.<br> There are so many differeny kinds of sushi, and like Ramen, it is costomizable.<br>
