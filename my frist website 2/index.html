          <font color="#00b8e6"> Hey-o I'm Faydra! Welcome to my really crappy webisite. In this website you will find many interesting things<br>
              about me. I will talk about many things, such as my hobbies, favorite music, and favorite foods. <br>
              A few of my favorite things to do are drawing and painting, <br>
              making and listening to music, cooking, and dancing. I really like animals and I currently have 3 cats named C.C. <br>
              (7 years old), Baby Belle (4 years old), and Kovu (2 years old). I also have 3 goldfish, all named susan <br>
              (im v creative), 2 leopard Geckos, Joel and Lizzie, a Beta fish named Bill, and a tiger salamander named Jerry. <br>
              I used to have a dog, but he passed a little over a year ago.<br>
              <br>
              I really like Music, and know how to play the ukulele and am teaching myself bass guitar and piano. <br>
              I don't really have a favorite music genre, as I am open to listing to any music and am always happy to discover <br>
              new artists (except country music i refuse to listen to that oof).
              <br>
              Some time in my life I would like to visit Japan. It has been my dream since I was little.<br>
              My Great Grandma is Japanese, and a few of my other family members were born in Japan. Another thing I want to do there is try all kinds of <br>
              food. Japanese food is my absolute favorite and one of my other dreams is owning my own ramen shop.
              <br> <br> Anyways that's about
              it this went on for way too long but I guess I just like telling people weird things about myself. Im probably <br>
              really boring tbh. oh well</font> <br> <br>
