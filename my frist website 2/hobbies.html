<h2><font color=white><u> Cooking </u></h2>

  <br>
  <font color="00b8e6"> One of my favorite things to do is cooking. I love being able to create what i want to using food. <br>
                        To me, cooking is very calming and therapeutic. Seeing the end result is satisfying, especially if it turned out good.<br>
                        cooking and food can bring people together and make anyones day 100x better. <br><br>
<h2><font color=white><u> Music </u></h2>

  <br>
  <font color="00b8e6"> Music is my passion. I love both listening to music and creating music. I listen to music all of the time, whether<br>
                        I'm drawing, reading, painting, sleeping, or even doing school work. It helps me keep calm and focus<br>
                        on what I am doing. Making music is also really fun. Much like cooking it is satisfying to see the end result,<br>
                        especially for someone like me who has to make everything perfect.<br><br>
<h2><font color=white><u> Art </u></h2>

  <br>
  <font color="00b8e6"> I love drawing and creating art. It helps me focus and calm down. If I am feeling stressed I will try and paint <br>
                        something. I am almost always doodling, and most of my homework will have sketches on it. Drawing is something I've <br>
                        always loved. I've been drwaing for as long as I can remember. Sometimes, if I am having an art block, it can be <br>
                        more frustrating than relaxing.<br>
